* on average the temperature was 3 degrees lower in December compared to In June
* the coldest day in december was 56 compared to 64 in June
* December had less data to work with as you can see by the count at top being lower by about 200


## Summmary
while the data shows that if does get colder in Oahu in december, only by a couple degrees and it stays pretty nice year round. While the minimums for both months might be a bit too cold for surfing and ice cream, the highest of the months are great for it even in December. This means that while every day may not be a top seller, business should be good year round. A good wetsuit could also go a long way and surfers can be quite passionate and will probably surf in much colder if the waves are good. Other good querys to run could be to get the precipitation for each month and maybe the elevation of the station that took them becaue if they are high up in the mountains it could be a lot colder compared to on the beach.
